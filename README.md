# Overview
The repo contains [Qt](http://qt.io) projects for dynamic situational awareness applications that can be run from within the Qt Creator IDE.

## Quick start

If you just want to grab the latest code and build the project, these are the quick steps:
 
 * `git clone https://github.com/ArcGIS/dynamic-situational-awareness-qt.git`
 * `cd dynamic-situational-awareness-qt`
 * `git clone https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt.git`
 * Open `DSA.pro` with Qt Creator, configure the projects and build.

# Prerequisites
* ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt 100.2.1
* Qt SDK 5.9.2 or higher
* Qt Creator
* ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt C++ Plugin [(details)](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt)
* For Windows: Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 14.0 
* For more information, please visit the [System Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/quartz/qml/guide/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt-system-requirements.htm) page.

### Setup the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK C++ Toolkit](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt) as a build dependency.

- This is an optional step but allows you to build with the latest version of the toolkit

```
# from the base of the repo
git clone https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt
```
